Last game i made in Unity back in 2016 to test everything i had learn so far + learning particule effect like smokes + character animation and control liking. Game design wise it was the most polished and complete so far, it was good learning material
Javascript files are in Assets\Scripts, two images of what the game and the scene screen in unity look like

TO DO LIST:
- All scripts are unlinked to all object and cant be relinked, apparently unity say the doesnt compile, but did previously and nothing seems wrong code wise, importing the project and updating it to current Unity version caused the problem (also reinstallied unity, maybe its an option problem)

-upload to Unity and create .exe (cant create a build after exporting the project and updating it to current Unity version, apparently scripts are the issue)
-restest and do bug fix list (current scripts pose build issue and cant compile)
-fix bugs, improve control, ui and twik sound and graphic to make it more enjoyable
- improve game design aspect (bonus, malus, speed modifier, ...)
-dont forget to playtest
